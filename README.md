## Description

This application allows the user to input notes into an online database so that they can access their notes from any computer they are using that has access to internet. This will help the user keep track of their notes and they will not have to worry about forgetting a paper note since it can be accessed anywhere that there is internet. 

## Installation

  - First clone this repository to your local device and use VS code or another code editor for the next steps. 
  - Once you have opened the cloned folder in your code editer, make sure that you have node.js installed on your computer. 
  - Run "npm init -y" in the terminal and then run "npm i" to install the "uuid" and "express" packages. 

## Usage

  - Click on "Get Started" and a new page will load to enter notes. 
  - Enter a title and then below the title enter in the note contents. 
  - When you are satisfied with your note, click on the save icon in the upper right corner. 
  - The delete button does work so once you have completed the task or no longer need the reminder, simply click the trash can and the note will be removed.
